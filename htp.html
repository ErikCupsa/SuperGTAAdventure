     If you've ever played Flappy Bird, our game is similar, however with a slighly different twist. You can choose to from 5 different characters, including the three main characters from Grand Theft Auto 5, and two Fortnite skins. The goal of the game is to jetpack your character through levels, avoiding buildings, helicopters and planes.

     <b>Flying controls:</b><br/>
     Fly upwards: Space key<br/>
     Fly downwards: Down arrow<br/>
    <br/><br/>
     -FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY-<br/> 
     Skip level: Backspace<br/><br/>
     
     There are currently 5 levels in our game, each of which increases slightly in difficulty. Keep in mind that some parts of the game such as obstacles are generated randomly, meaning that in the margin of error, the game could be impossible at some points.<br/><br/>
Good luck!
